                        for home invasion? What if it there was a system that could be used to deter burglars not only through alarms and lights but also through making the house seem as though there are people in it? &nbsp;Terry is a drone that has been
                        created to do all of those things with the intention of providing a more effective means of home security, stopping the burglar even before they get into the house. This can be seen in the drones main aspects:<br><br></p>

                        speaking system. We also used the feedback to further improve the app. We saw that aspects such as the map, community and the lack of a tutorial were all matters that needed to be attended to. After these issues were resolved we
                        produced a product that we believe effectively improves the home security of a user.<br></p>
