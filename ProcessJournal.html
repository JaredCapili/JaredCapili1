        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>This is my process journal that will describe the process and steps our group has taken to coming to a high fidelity prototype for my class DECO2200. The process journal will include background research, how we decided what are of study we will
            be researching, iterations, problems and solutions, and how got to our high fidelity prototype. Our group decided to focus on researching the topic of home security and finding a way autonomous drones/vehicles would be able to assist in home
            security. The main problem of home security was burglaries which we already knew as a group but what we didn’t know was how, and what could be done to prevent it. As a result we were keen to figure out and study this topic area as we saw it
            had potential for the use of autonomous drones as well as found it to be an interesting topic. We used various research methods, developed prototypes,choose a final concept and eventually tweaked/modified a concept that later on became our
            high fidelity prototype. This process is documented and shown in this process journal. <br></p>

        <h1>Background Research</h1>
        <p>What did we initially research?<br>Initially we decided to go through and brainstorm multiple areas that we found would be interesting for autonomous drones and vehicles to be implemented in. We also researched how autonomous drones and vehicles
            are being used currently. This was done to help us with picking an area of study to focus on. The first area of study we picked was the medical field. We were also told to be more specific as medical is very general. As a result we decided
            on dementia.<br></p>

        <p>Why did we change what we wanted to research?<br>We ended up having to change our area of research as dementia would be an extremely hard topic of research, especially when implementing autonomous drones and vehicles. As a result we had to choose
            another research topic instead.<br></p>

        <p>What we ended up with and why?<br>After long discussions and a multitude of brainstorms we decided that we were running out of time and needed to pick an area of study soon. As a result we narrowed it down to a few topics. Waste, emergency services
            and home security. The majority of the group decided home security would be the best topic area to research. We started to research the main problems encountered within home security. We found multiple problems such as people forgetting to
            turn on their alarms and people simply forgetting to lock their doors. This was found after multiple interviews were conducted and questionnaires were sent out to people of varying demographics. Once we compiled the data, we found that the
            data sets were far too similar and as a result had to collect more data from a more diverse set of participants to find problems that people face in regards to home security. We decided to split up and each research different types of homes
            and how they deal with home security. I decided to research share houses while the other two group members researched, normal houses and apartments. This was done through interviews and surveys.<br><br>Research Methods:<br>Interviews and surveys<br>We
            conducted one round of interviews and surveys that was sent out to the general public then we sent another round of interviews that was sent out for specific people living in each house type we studied individually. The groups of people we
            interviewed differed in age, demographic, and most importantly type of house they lived in. From the data, i created statement cards which then showed that most people wanted some sort of trustworthy presence in a house to keep it from being
            targeted whilst still having an alarm system to prevent a robber from being able to steal anything before getting caught. This gave me some direction of the features and capabilities the solution would consist of. We also researched previous
            technologies and products<br>Analysis method:<br>Statement cards<br></p>

        <p>The angle we ended up going with and why?According to our research we decided to research how to keep normal homes safe whilst using research found when we researched the other types of homes to come up with a more effective means of home security.
            What we found from the research was that scaring the burglar was the best way to deter a robber. As a result we decided to focus on scaring the burglar in some way.<br><br>What and how we researched further into the problem area?<br>We then
            started to research more and more into home security, and autonomous drones and vehicles as well, by looking further into autonomous drones and what their capabilities were. One of the drones we researched was the harvard microtechnology be
            drone. This gave us an idea of how small drones could get. Our group started to brainstorm aspects of home security to gain a deeper understanding of the area we choose to study. We then started to come up with concepts that were unrealistic
            and without boundaries so that we could get an idea of what our concepts would be and in what direction they would be going in.<br><br>Research methods<br>Brain writing: we used brain writing to help us improve our concepts as well as rapidly
            come up with concepts that may help us find a final solution.&nbsp;<br>Brainstorming: Once we had our ideas we started to brainstorm various aspects and features that would make up each of our concepts.<br><br><br></p>

        <p>Iterations and ideas<br>We ended up creating 4 different concepts after narrowing down our more concepts and taking aspects from each concept to come up with a more realistic concept that would be more suitable for the task. Out of the 4 we narrowed

        <p>In our research we found that there are many factors that are effective in deterring the robber as it scares them as well as increases the risks the robbers take. As a result our designs mainly consisted of features that would scare the burglar
            through alarms and the replication of a presence in the house (this will be further explained later on). It also consisted of surveillance aspects. We found that the main aspects of the concepts included:<br>&nbsp;- Lights<br>&nbsp;- Camera<br>&nbsp;-
            Audio to replicate a home presence&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;- Alarms<br>&nbsp;- Camouflage (to make sure the robber wouldn’t see the drone which would defeat the purpose for the presence in a home and also so they wouldn’t ruin the drone)<br>The aspect
            of replicating a home presence, relates more to making it look like someone is home so that the robber would choose a different home as it would be too risky for them to target that specific house. <br></p>

    <div class="container" id="User-Research">
        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>What we came up with in terms of the design’s final physical concept was an updated version of the roomba concept. This version mainly had features that originally came from the roomba concept but also mixed features from the previous 4 concepts.
            This idea was the most suitable choice as it fit our goal of “scaring the robber” and replicating a “presence in the “home”. This can be seen by its audio features that are meant to replicate the presence in the home as well as the alarm that
            was built into the drone. In our research we found that alarms were the most effective way of deterring an intruder and as a result we incorporated it into the final concept as it was a fundamental aspect of security. The other concept wasn’t
            chosen as it wasn’t feasible and didn’t have any means of replicating a presence in the home. As a result it wasn’t picked but aspects with in that specific concept were taken. The aspect of surveillance was taken from the previous concept,
            allowing us to create a better, more effective product. We liked the idea of a drone that produces audio whilst simultaneously monitoring the home as it was not only securing the house, but also creating a presence in the home. Due to the
            idea of replicating a presence at home to keep users safe, we decided to call our roomba product “Terry” to give it a more personal feel for homeowners. <br>After the final concept (Terry) was chosen, we created iterations for the user interface.
            We all made many iterations individually. We then came together, looked at all the iterations and started to pick what we liked about certain iterations and what we didn’t like. We then, as a group, started to make more iterations. In the
            end we came up with two ideas for iterations:<br><br><br></p>

                <p><strong>The App: </strong>This iteration is an app that will allow the homeowner to observe Terry’s autonomous decisions but also manually control Terry if needed. It gives the user access to Terry’s live feed and allows for the Terry
                    drone to be customised which would allow for personalisation for the homeowner. It would also be used to notify police of any activity that may have occurred that the homeowner is alerted to.<br></p>

    <p>User Testing Methods:<br>Contextual Observation<br>Think Aloud<br>A/B Testing<br>We used these methods to better compare the two interfaces as well as receive feedback and advice on how to improve the two interfaces.<br><br>User tests analysis<br>From
        the research and tests, we gathered that the app was easier to use than the speaking systems, which was interesting as we predicted otherwise. This was due to the fact that users didn’t know what the commands were, making the speaking system a
        lot harder to use. Users said they felt more comfortable using the app, as buttons provide more confirmation for them. The matter of privacy was also brought up as users thought there would be a lack of privacy when using the speaking system if
        the user was using the app on say a train. <br><br>We chose to go with the iteration of the app and further develop it to become a more effective and easy to use platform for the homeowner. This was a result of the user testing data we received
        as well as the fact that the smart speaking system iteration was not feasible at all.<br><br><br>The feedback received gave us an idea of where to go with the product and how to improve it. Some of the feedback we received for the app included:<br>&nbsp;-
        House map was confusing<br>&nbsp;- Need a tutorial or walk through<br>&nbsp;- There should be a sign out button<br>&nbsp;- What would happen if you had a pet<br>&nbsp;- Users tried to tap on alert panels in community section when i wouldn’t go

        <p>User tests and results<br>After testing the high fidelity prototype, we were pleased with the feedback we received as it was mostly positive. It gave us confirmation that we have done alright. The product looked very pleasing to the eye and didn’t
            come across as some cheap prototype and this was noticed by the users testing the app. One piece of feedback that was common amongst the users being tested was that the pop ups and notifications were very effective and really made the app
            feel professional.<br><br><br>What we came up with and why?<br>In the end what we came up with was a high fidelity interface prototype used to control and observe and autonomous drone capable of surveying a house and keeping it safe through
            the use of sounds to replicate a presence in the house. Terry is also linked to the home alarm system to keep burglars from entering the house and keeping the family safe. Terry loves to keep the house safe. The interface we designed went
            through multiple iterations and with each iteration the interface design was slightly enhanced through upgrades made based on the user feedback<br><br>The final product<br>After many attempts and a lot of trial and error, we finally came up
            with an interactive prototype that seemed to meet our standards. Not gonna lie, most of the journey, from start to finish, was full of mistakes and research being incorrectly conducted. To be honest, i really thought this was gonna be a massive
            train wreck, and i was right up until the high fidelity interactive prototype came out really nicely. Kind of like driving without directions and somehow getting to your destination. I guess that’s basically the design process at times. So
            in a way this whole project was a metaphor for how the design process isn’t really linear but more of &nbsp;big scribble trying to eventually narrow itself down to a solution. <br><br>The things we changed<br>In the end we added pop ups, notification
            screens, multiple types of buttons and a lot of pages as well as buttons to build the feeling of confirmation within the user. The house map was also implemented again as the user feedback suggested it. We decided to delve deeper into why
            though. Why the house map failed in the first place and what could’ve made the house map more clearer. In the end we found that having a brief note/description of each page was the most simplest method the fix problems, not only in the house
            map but also in almost every screen. We also added the certain features to give the user a little more control over the drone, such as a way to control the drone as well as a way to use the alarm and notify police button whilst still in full
            screen.<br><br>What i learnt/personal thoughts<br>We learned that listening to feedback literally rather than using our design deduction is a big mistake as the house map situation showed us. I also learned that people would sometimes rather
            confirmation rather convenience. Instead of deleting a screen because a user doesn’t think it’s necessary, we should improve it’s affordance and clarity<br></p>
